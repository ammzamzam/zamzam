What drives the price of a car?
############

In this application, using dataset from Kaggle.com, a CRISP-DM Framework was utilized to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. These findings were presented to a used car dealership as recommendations.A subset of the full dataset was developed to deliver a high-quality model. This final model contained only vehicles models from year 2001 till 2021. The reason for this was to eliminate the effect of cars sold as vintage or antique and to produce model estimates that could be applied to current majority of used vehicles holding the same year of make range.#########

Main Finding

In vehicle models from year 2001 to 2021, customers value a vehicle primarily by its year of make (the recent the better) and odometer (the smaller millage the better). Other factors, especially for cars, are fuel (electric), type (coupe), and cylinders (12, 8, then 10). Factors such as transmission, paint color and condition are not as important.
