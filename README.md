#### Executive summary

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are highly prevalent globally and are known to be associated with an accumulation of fatty deposits inside the arteries and an increased risk of blood clots. The challenge is identifying those patients at early stages of CVD. As a significant number of patients with CVD are either undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or diagnosed at late disease stage, putting them at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
An urgent need for a convenient and reliable medical test that can be utilized to classify patients who are at risk of CVD.

#### Rationale
Patients managed at early CVD stage see improvements in their lifestyle and avoid unfavorable complications. Moreover, a delayed diagnosis of CVD can threaten prognosis, and overwhelm the healthcare system economically. 

#### Research Question
The objective of this research is to present a model that can classify patients with high risk of developing CVD given their plasma proteins levels and other confounding features.

#### Data Sources

A retrospective dataset collected from actual patients from a hospital. The dataset contains blood work analysis for five potential plasma proteins, clinical characteristics, and nine different outcomes. The collected data are anonymous to ensure that no one can connect the data to the individual who provided it through direct identifiers or indirect identifiers.


#### Methodology

Classification model was used to answer the research question. Decision trees as a supervised learning method was used first for classification. Then, random forest as an ensemble technique that include multiple decision trees was used. With the help of several model accuracy measurements, the best model was chosen which can then be utilized to answer the research question.

#### Results

In predicting outcome 8, "the best" random forest model preformed slightly better than "the best" decision tress in all model scores such as accuracy (89% vs. 88%), recall, (89% vs. 88%) and precision (90% vs. 86%). 
Plasma proteins 4,1, and 5 are important predictors and should be measured along with other features to estimate the risk of outcome 8.
