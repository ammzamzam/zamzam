##########


Bar Coupon Conclusion
Based on primary analysis, we can say that drivers who visit a bar more frequent are the ones who are most likely to accept the bar coupon. Also, there is no significant association between age group (≤25 and >25) and bar group (less than once a month and more than once a month) in terms of bar coupon acceptance rate. However, when we compare on subgroup to the rest, more than third of those who accepted bar coupons are above age 25 and are going to a bar more than once a month. The only conclusive finding is that frequent bar visitors who are more than 25a are more likely to reject the bar coupon.Further analysis maybe required to see the effects of gender, time before the bar coupon expires and distance to bar. Also, comparing unbalanced subgroups as mentioned earlier should be handled with caution.####Coffee House Coupon ConclusionFrom the primary analysis of the coffee house coupon data, we can say there are several factors that contribute to accepting the coupons. The most prominent are being a frequent visitor single male with a bachelor’s degree or in college or being a frequent visitor married female with a bachelor’s degree or in college.On the other hand, drivers who visit a coffee house 1 time or less in month and receive a 2-hour expiration on a coffee house coupon are more likely to reject it.
