In this project I will be using real data collected from 917 patients. The dataset contains 17 features for each patient (5 proteins levels and 12 clinical demographics) and nine different outcomes. 

The goal here is to use the presented features to predict or classify the outcomes. The given five proteins are blood biomarkers collected from the patients through a specific plasma blood analysis. It is important to note that outcome 8, is the project primary outcome. Hence, I will be building my models based on this outcome. Then I will follow the analysis for the remaining secondary outcomes. The outcomes are labeled “0” outcome absent and “1” outcome present.
After selecting the best model to explain the data, I will be able to identify which protein levels and which features are contributing to a certain outcome.These patients' outcomes are costly to manage and better to be treated at early stages. Moreover, most patients have no symptoms especially at early stages. Being able to identify cut-off points for these proteins to classify patients is helpful for medical practice. As health care practitioners will be able to utilize these cut-off points through a simple blood test to predict a certain outcome for a patient. This early diagnosis is better for patient’s health and economically beneficial to the health care system.For outcome 8 (the primary outcome), I can see that logistic regression model was the best classifier. This is based on the accuracy scores 82% and AUC 0.82. This tells us that using the dataset features we can classify patients into who will develop outcome 8 in the future.I would choose a classification using decision tree with criterion = entropy, max depth = 8, min samples leaf = 2, min samples split = 0.1 over the logistic regression model. Although the decision tree classifier had slight lower accuracy than logistic region model, it had a higher recall score of 0.63. As this will assure that the false negatives are minimal. As a result, the minimum number of potential sick patients will be missed.

The resulting cut-off values for the given proteins in the decision tree can be used in practice, as health care practitioners can utilize those cut-off points to classify patients with outcome 8.
