A summary of findings and link to notebook
All models have the same score (accuracy). However, variability is noticed in precision, recall and AUC. Although it did not have the highest precision, I would choose the decision tree model as it had the highest recall and AUC scores.
A classification using decision tree with criterion = gini, max depth = 8, min samples leaf = 5, min samples split = 0.01 will assure that the false negatives are minimal. As a result, the minimum number of potential customers for a term deposit subscription will be missed.
Limitations:* A low recall score means high number of false negatives which can be a result of imbalanced class.* The model might be overfitted* Using decision tree classifier had the longest computation time compared to other classifiers.
RecommendationsIdentifying important features to include in the model would improve the model scores and prevent overfitting.
